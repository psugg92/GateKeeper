# Dungeon Keeper
This project was created by Peter Sugg, Jason Simons, and Matt Bolten.

### Dungeon Keeper's Goal
The goal of Dungeon Keeper is to be a Dungeon Master's Resource, a place where a Dungeon Master can keep up with notes about their world and keep track of encounters that adventurers will come in contact with.
