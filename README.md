# Covalence Full Stack Project Boilerplate
This boilerplate includes build scripts and setup for a ReactJS front-end and an ExpressJS back-end.

### Getting Started
Remember to run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies.

### Careful!
Make sure you are always working within the front-end or back-end `src` directory. Stay out of the `dist` and `lib` directories, as their contents will be erased each time the source code is transpiled.

### Running
* To run the project during development (for automatic transpile and server restart), use `npm run dev`.
* `npm run start` will be used in a production environment. It transpiles once and does not look for changes.
